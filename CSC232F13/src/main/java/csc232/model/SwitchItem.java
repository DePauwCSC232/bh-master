/**
 * A <code>SwitchItem</code> behaves like an ordinary {@link ContainerItem},
 * except when a trigger object is added to it, it switches to the triggered
 * state: the description will change, and the hidden object (if not null) will
 * be added to the container. Furthermore, if it is being used as a location, a
 * new or modified exit will be inserted in the map, going in the specified
 * direction and leading to the specified neighbor. Finally, the
 * <code>keep</code> flag determines whether the trigger item is actually added
 * or whether it is discarded.
